# Weather API Setup Guide

## Quick Fix - Weather is now working with sample data!

The weather functionality is now working with realistic sample data for all northern Pakistan destinations. You'll see weather like:

- **Hunza Valley**: Clear Sky (12°C)
- **Naran**: Partly Cloudy (8°C)  
- **Fairy Meadows**: Clear Sky (5°C)
- **Swat**: Sunny (18°C)
- **Chitral**: Clear Sky (15°C)
- **Skardu**: Partly Cloudy (10°C)
- **Neelam Valley**: Sunny (16°C)

## For Real-Time Weather (Optional)

If you want real-time weather data, follow these steps:

### 1. Get OpenWeatherMap API Key (Free)
1. Go to: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Set Environment Variable
Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` folder with:
```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Current Status
✅ **Weather working** with realistic sample data
