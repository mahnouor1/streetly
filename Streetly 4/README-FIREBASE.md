## 🌐 Access Your Frontend

- **Local Development**: http://localhost:5000

## ⚠️ Important Notes

## 🔗 Backend Connection

Your frontend will connect to your FastAPI backend running on port 8080. Make sure your backend is running:

```bash
cd "/Users/Maha/Downloads/stee/backend"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

## 📱 Firebase Project

This is configured for your **Streetly** Firebase project. The hosting will serve your exact frontend files with no modifications.
